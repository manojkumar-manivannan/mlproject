5,Ive been a Derwent fan for many years but I was still surprised by how much I enjoy working with these pencilsThey are very different from the Inktense line from Derwent which are fantastic as well These pencils are a bit grittier They seem to grab the paper a bit better than the Inktense The only downside is the color selection is far fewer than the Inktense so Ill be using them in conjunction with one another,1,"['Ive', 'Derwent', 'fan', 'many', 'years', 'I', 'still', 'surprised', 'much', 'I', 'enjoy', 'working', 'pencilsThey', 'different', 'Inktense', 'line', 'Derwent', 'fantastic', 'well', 'These', 'pencils', 'bit', 'grittier', 'They', 'seem', 'grab', 'paper', 'bit', 'better', 'Inktense', 'The', 'downside', 'color', 'selection', 'far', 'fewer', 'Inktense', 'Ill', 'using', 'conjunction', 'one', 'another']"

2,This printer was purchased for my home less than a year ago and I need to replace the ink cartridges for the rd time I am the only one in my home and I rarely use the printer I use it so rarely that the tips of the cartridges dried out and the printer wouldnt operate I had to clean cartridge heads as shown on YouTube I realize the original ink cartridges that came with the printer were sample size so didnt contain as much ink as a regular cartridge However I ordered replacements directly from Epson and they quickly ran out again example for XL black cartridge I think the ink must evaporate no other way to explain it unless the cartridges dont hold much ink If any one cartridge runs dry the printer wont operate The cartridges are very expensive and I have now spent as much on the ink cartridges as I paid for the printer It is just another scam like razor blades Once you purchase their product they make sure you can only use their refills and than charge an inflated price Thats where they make their money,0,"['This', 'printer', 'purchased', 'home', 'less', 'year', 'ago', 'I', 'need', 'replace', 'ink', 'cartridges', 'rd', 'time', 'I', 'one', 'home', 'I', 'rarely', 'use', 'printer', 'I', 'use', 'rarely', 'tips', 'cartridges', 'dried', 'printer', 'wouldnt', 'operate', 'I', 'clean', 'cartridge', 'heads', 'shown', 'YouTube', 'I', 'realize', 'original', 'ink', 'cartridges', 'came', 'printer', 'sample', 'size', 'didnt', 'contain', 'much', 'ink', 'regular', 'cartridge', 'However', 'I', 'ordered', 'replacements', 'directly', 'Epson', 'quickly', 'ran', 'example', 'XL', 'black', 'cartridge', 'I', 'think', 'ink', 'must', 'evaporate', 'way', 'explain', 'unless', 'cartridges', 'dont', 'hold', 'much', 'ink', 'If', 'one', 'cartridge', 'runs', 'dry', 'printer', 'wont', 'operate', 'The', 'cartridges', 'expensive', 'I', 'spent', 'much', 'ink', 'cartridges', 'I', 'paid', 'printer', 'It', 'another', 'scam', 'like', 'razor', 'blades', 'Once', 'purchase', 'product', 'make', 'sure', 'use', 'refills', 'charge', 'inflated', 'price', 'Thats', 'make', 'money']"
5,These lasers are among the best I have used Theyre nothing like those cheap flea market button cell lasers Oh dont shine them in anyones eyes especially the blue one I felt heat coming off that one The green one is the brightest of the and great for pointing at stars on a clear night Instead of using your finger which is not very accurate the green one can point accurately at a star so people around you can see what youre looking at The blue one is more of a blacklight laser It shines very brightly when hitting white material I measured the core temperature of the blue one which was around degrees Fahrenheit inside the diode The red laser is much brighter than even the dollar ones at OfficeMax All these lasers dont suffer from the dreaded dieout effect I get a constant steady power stream from start to finish Although the product says it doesnt come with AAA batteries It does just two however These batteries are offbrand they died out quickly but for batteries that I wasnt supposed to get they were pretty good Build quality is superb The body is a black soft touch paint and everything else is a nice strong metal Overall a very nice product and great deal,1,"['These', 'lasers', 'among', 'best', 'I', 'used', 'Theyre', 'nothing', 'like', 'cheap', 'flea', 'market', 'button', 'cell', 'lasers', 'Oh', 'dont', 'shine', 'anyones', 'eyes', 'especially', 'blue', 'one', 'I', 'felt', 'heat', 'coming', 'one', 'The', 'green', 'one', 'brightest', 'great', 'pointing', 'stars', 'clear', 'night', 'Instead', 'using', 'finger', 'accurate', 'green', 'one', 'point', 'accurately', 'star', 'people', 'around', 'see', 'youre', 'looking', 'The', 'blue', 'one', 'blacklight', 'laser', 'It', 'shines', 'brightly', 'hitting', 'white', 'material', 'I', 'measured', 'core', 'temperature', 'blue', 'one', 'around', 'degrees', 'Fahrenheit', 'inside', 'diode', 'The', 'red', 'laser', 'much', 'brighter', 'even', 'dollar', 'ones', 'OfficeMax', 'All', 'lasers', 'dont', 'suffer', 'dreaded', 'dieout', 'effect', 'I', 'get', 'constant', 'steady', 'power', 'stream', 'start', 'finish', 'Although', 'product', 'says', 'doesnt', 'come', 'AAA', 'batteries', 'It', 'two', 'however', 'These', 'batteries', 'offbrand', 'died', 'quickly', 'batteries', 'I', 'wasnt', 'supposed', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'Build', 'quality', 'superb', 'The', 'body', 'black', 'soft', 'touch', 'paint', 'everything', 'else', 'nice', 'strong', 'metal', 'Overall', 'nice', 'product', 'great', 'deal']"

1,MY POOR RATING HERE IS NOT FOR HP INK CARTRIDGES BUT RATHER FOR MY PURCHASE OF THE HPXL CARTRIDGE THROUGH ASHBY STORE AND FULFILLED BY AMAZONI am one of Amazons biggest fans I believe they generally have the best prices and service around As a result I buy just about everything I possibly can through Amazoncom However this was definitely the WORST purchase I have ever had through AmazonThis seller Ashby Store is quite clearly one of the very worst The Hewlett Packard HPXL tricolor ink cartridge I bought from them fulfilled by Amazon was absolute JUNK To begin with the Amazon packaging box was in perfect condition but the HP box was very beat up and looked old On top of that the HP box was clearly intended to be sold only in a Spanishspeaking country as it was primarily in Spanish listed HP as the Exportador and listed three different Argentinian Brazilian and Mexican companies for which it was ImportadoThe area of the HP box that states the Warranty End Date had that end date carefully and suspiciously covered by a professionallooking sticker identifying the cartridge and stating it was new The HP box which looked as though it might have been previously opened and then resealed contained the usual inner white thin cardboard enclosure that holds the cartridge and that white enclosure also looked as though it might have been previously opened Once I took the cartridge completely out of all packaging the sticker that usually covers the inkjet outlets had ink that had leaked onto it Further the warranty end date printed on the cartridge itself was which translates to March and means the cartridge I received on was more than ten months beyond its warranty expiration date while still being sold at a retail priceJust to be sure of my suspicions I went ahead and installed the cartridge in my printer and then attempted to do the usual printer alignment The page that was printed barely had a mark on it and the printer was telling me to try to do another alignment page Instead I tried the printers clean cartridge maintenance function but again got very poor results with only about of the usual coverage That was enough for meI was desperate to replace the old empty HPXL cartridge that was in my printer so I got a Staples coupon for off and paid for it even less than what I paid through Amazon After installing that new HPXL cartridge from Staples my printer worked perfectlyThe only positive THING I can relate about this experience was Amazons excellent customer service I called them and was immediately issued a refund along with having them set up a free pickup of the WORTHLESS junk cartridge by UPSIF I COULD RATE ASHBY STORE AND THIS PURCHASE WITH FIVE NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD DO SO BUT THATS NOT POSSIBLE THE WORST THEY CAN RECEIVE IT ONE

1,I followed all of the instructions installed the software and connected the device When I tried to capture an image it said Scanner is not connected I went on the Veho website and saw this problem in the FAQ section Their solution is to make sure you are using a USB port and preferably one that is on your computer not a hub I was already doing that Then it says sometimes it cant detect your scanner if you have other image capture devices plugged in other scanners printers so I unplugged all of my other USB devices and restarted my computer Still nothing I uninstalled the software and reinstalled it using the download on their website instead of the disc that came with my scanner and it still didnt work I tried installing on two other computers and it didnt work on those eitherIf you could use this scanner with the native image capture program on your computer I wouldnt care about this issue at all but it ONLY works with this software Either my scanner is defective or and I think this is more likely since somebody else already left a review saying it doesnt work with Macbook Air it just doesnt work with macs All three of my computer are macs imac desktops and one macbook air running Lion and one running Snow Leopard so I cant test it on a PC for comparison but Id definitely be wary of ordering this model if you only have a mac,0,"['I', 'followed', 'instructions', 'installed', 'software', 'connected', 'device', 'When', 'I', 'tried', 'capture', 'image', 'said', 'Scanner', 'connected', 'I', 'went', 'Veho', 'website', 'saw', 'problem', 'FAQ', 'section', 'Their', 'solution', 'make', 'sure', 'using', 'USB', 'port', 'preferably', 'one', 'computer', 'hub', 'I', 'already', 'Then', 'says', 'sometimes', 'cant', 'detect', 'scanner', 'image', 'capture', 'devices', 'plugged', 'scanners', 'printers', 'I', 'unplugged', 'USB', 'devices', 'restarted', 'computer', 'Still', 'nothing', 'I', 'uninstalled', 'software', 'reinstalled', 'using', 'download', 'website', 'instead', 'disc', 'came', 'scanner', 'still', 'didnt', 'work', 'I', 'tried', 'installing', 'two', 'computers', 'didnt', 'work', 'eitherIf', 'could', 'use', 'scanner', 'native', 'image', 'capture', 'program', 'computer', 'I', 'wouldnt', 'care', 'issue', 'ONLY', 'works', 'software', 'Either', 'scanner', 'defective', 'I', 'think', 'likely', 'since', 'somebody', 'else', 'already', 'left', 'review', 'saying', 'doesnt', 'work', 'Macbook', 'Air', 'doesnt', 'work', 'macs', 'All', 'three', 'computer', 'macs', 'imac', 'desktops', 'one', 'macbook', 'air', 'running', 'Lion', 'one', 'running', 'Snow', 'Leopard', 'I', 'cant', 'test', 'PC', 'comparison', 'Id', 'definitely', 'wary', 'ordering', 'model', 'mac']"

3,This isnt a terrible printer on its own but Epsons cartridges for it are a huge joke I started out using the pack that came with it Which literally lasted only a couple uses I was amazed I figured it was maybe just a sample pack and so I didnt get to upset I went and bought a new one at the store Same exact thing Even though I NEVER use color I found that the color ink would be gone extremely fast regardless and the black lasted maybe or pages Needless to say I just couldnt afford this I then bought some off brand cartridges off ebay and I was amazed The black ink lasted me about a year of daily printing or pages a day I have no clue how that is even possible but I was amazed Not the best printer but if you buy nonoem ink where there not filling it up a th of the way to rip you off then its alright I could care less about it voiding my warranty if it does I dont really want to deal with epson anyway,0,"['This', 'isnt', 'terrible', 'printer', 'Epsons', 'cartridges', 'huge', 'joke', 'I', 'started', 'using', 'pack', 'came', 'Which', 'literally', 'lasted', 'couple', 'uses', 'I', 'amazed', 'I', 'figured', 'maybe', 'sample', 'pack', 'I', 'didnt', 'get', 'upset', 'I', 'went', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'store', 'Same', 'exact', 'thing', 'Even', 'though', 'I', 'NEVER', 'use', 'color', 'I', 'found', 'color', 'ink', 'would', 'gone', 'extremely', 'fast', 'regardless', 'black', 'lasted', 'maybe', 'pages', 'Needless', 'say', 'I', 'couldnt', 'afford', 'I', 'bought', 'brand', 'cartridges', 'ebay', 'I', 'amazed', 'The', 'black', 'ink', 'lasted', 'year', 'daily', 'printing', 'pages', 'day', 'I', 'clue', 'even', 'possible', 'I', 'amazed', 'Not', 'best', 'printer', 'buy', 'nonoem', 'ink', 'filling', 'th', 'way', 'rip', 'alright', 'I', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'voiding', 'warranty', 'I', 'dont', 'really', 'want', 'deal', 'epson', 'anyway']"

1,I have an older version of this printer The good It does all the AIO functions fairly well when working The major physical problem is a poorly designed feeder that clogs easily and is difficult to clear properly The horrible Really bad software Dishonest ink usage figures that shut down the printer instantaneously way before the ink is low So even if you check the ink level you cannot predict when it will run out One major problem is the software It frequently causes malfunctions Sometimes this can be resolved by downloading new drivers Other times it takes literally days working with tech support Beyond that the rigging of the printer to report low ink levels is dishonest and frankly fraudulent From posts on the net it seems that the ink refills timeout and after a date will give a lo ink reading even if the ink is not depleted This is important because of the very high cost of the cartridges The ink supply becomes low and the AIO shuts down totally even if it only tells you one ink is low So if it thinks you are low on cyan you cannot even print in black and white It seems there is no override on these machines What a shame I have an HP Laserjet that had a similar problem how to override the automatic shutdown months ago and I still have no decrease in print quality So regardless of the reason this happens this is dishonest In my case I rarely use my AIO for printing and even more rarely for color printing Last weekend I wanted to make my first I think color copy except for test pages and was told the yellow was low I replaced it Then I was told all the other inks were low So I replaced them No go I suspect that the dates on the cartidges are old I always like to have extras and these have been around for a year So it is pretty obvious to me that something is fishy and comments from others on the web would back up this train ofthought And dont think I have had it out for HP I have used their products and been extremely happy for years I know members of the Packard family Sadly their great products and support are now just a memory Im not sure any of the other manufacturers today are any better Havent tried them but will soon Dr N,0,"['I', 'older', 'version', 'printer', 'The', 'good', 'It', 'AIO', 'functions', 'fairly', 'well', 'working', 'The', 'major', 'physical', 'problem', 'poorly', 'designed', 'feeder', 'clogs', 'easily', 'difficult', 'clear', 'properly', 'The', 'horrible', 'Really', 'bad', 'software', 'Dishonest', 'ink', 'usage', 'figures', 'shut', 'printer', 'instantaneously', 'way', 'ink', 'low', 'So', 'even', 'check', 'ink', 'level', 'predict', 'run', 'One', 'major', 'problem', 'software', 'It', 'frequently', 'causes', 'malfunctions', 'Sometimes', 'resolved', 'downloading', 'new', 'drivers', 'Other', 'times', 'takes', 'literally', 'days', 'working', 'tech', 'support', 'Beyond', 'rigging', 'printer', 'report', 'low', 'ink', 'levels', 'dishonest', 'frankly', 'fraudulent', 'From', 'posts', 'net', 'seems', 'ink', 'refills', 'timeout', 'date', 'give', 'lo', 'ink', 'reading', 'even', 'ink', 'depleted', 'This', 'important', 'high', 'cost', 'cartridges', 'The', 'ink', 'supply', 'becomes', 'low', 'AIO', 'shuts', 'totally', 'even', 'tells', 'one', 'ink', 'low', 'So', 'thinks', 'low', 'cyan', 'even', 'print', 'black', 'white', 'It', 'seems', 'override', 'machines', 'What', 'shame', 'I', 'HP', 'Laserjet', 'similar', 'problem', 'override', 'automatic', 'shutdown', 'months', 'ago', 'I', 'still', 'decrease', 'print', 'quality', 'So', 'regardless', 'reason', 'happens', 'dishonest', 'In', 'case', 'I', 'rarely', 'use', 'AIO', 'printing', 'even', 'rarely', 'color', 'printing', 'Last', 'weekend', 'I', 'wanted', 'make', 'first', 'I', 'think', 'color', 'copy', 'except', 'test', 'pages', 'told', 'yellow', 'low', 'I', 'replaced', 'Then', 'I', 'told', 'inks', 'low', 'So', 'I', 'replaced', 'No', 'go', 'I', 'suspect', 'dates', 'cartidges', 'old', 'I', 'always', 'like', 'extras', 'around', 'year', 'So', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'something', 'fishy', 'comments', 'others', 'web', 'would', 'back', 'train', 'ofthought', 'And', 'dont', 'think', 'I', 'HP', 'I', 'used', 'products', 'extremely', 'happy', 'years', 'I', 'know', 'members', 'Packard', 'family', 'Sadly', 'great', 'products', 'support', 'memory', 'Im', 'sure', 'manufacturers', 'today', 'better', 'Havent', 'tried', 'soon', 'Dr', 'N']"

3,Of all the aftermarket keyboard trays I could find that came with a mouse rest this was the best designed for me and I think its a great design for many people as we all are designed a little differently Depending on how you sit and where you want your mouse the standard square slot for a mouse next to the keyboard is impractical for many I really like the easyswingout option for using my mouse I use Apples Magic Mouse on this surface and Ive never had an issue with the mousepad surface being too reflective so that would interfere with the light reader in the mouse I have never used a mouse with the oldstyle ball tracker with this trayI give stars for the durability of this tray Its easy to adjust as you need it to and does not lose its place over timeIve taken off a couple of stars for the big time annoyances I have with keeping this clean The stock imagery they show has a keyboard in place and doesnt show you what it looks like without the keyboard there There are two thin black foamtype patches glued to the base to keep the keyboard from sliding It appears that a layer of glueadhesive was laid down then the foam patches were laid down later by someone who didnt line them up just right as around the bottom and one side of the patches is a halo of adhesive that absorbs all manner of hair skin dust and any debris you can imagine The edges of the foam patches disintegrate after time and not a very long time either so I am constantly using a baby wipe to remove the thousands of little black dots all over the trayI have a wireless keyboard sometimes I have it tilted so that the bottom of the keyboard near the space bar is resting on the wrist pad The keyboard gets moved around as I need it and as it feels good on my wrists and then I see that black stuff all over the tray It looks like I am eating Oreo cookies when I move the keyboard Its embarrassing Ill have someone in my office and the debris there just looks nasty I try to keep my keyboard clean and everything free from skin and other officesupply type ickies with continued use but the dissolving foam patches make it almost an effort in futility The foam patches have a perpetual case of seborrhea or psoriasis The sluffing off of material is CONSTANT I will clean everything and in minutes I have another black dots all over the placeWere it not for this one issue it would be a near perfect desk accessory tray The installation screws on the back have no caps so those are dust and debris catchers as well If you snack on anything there will be crumbs there but nothing is quite as annoying as those black dots everywhere and the halo of adhesive that has black dots hair and debris permanently affixed It makes it look grubby no matter how clean I try to make it appearmy office

on anything there will be crumbs there but nothing is quite as annoying as those black dots everywhere and the halo of adhesive that has black dots hair and debris permanently affixed It makes it look

1,So let me first start off with the only good note on this printer like the other reviews it is extremely easy to setup the wireless printing feature on this printer and the printer itself prints nicely even in draft mode HOWEVER this printer is a complete disaster from a user perspective Unless you have an endless money supply and dont mind stock piling plenty of replacement cartridgesThis printer is the last straw for me in purchasing HP Inkjet Printer products This printers design clearly shows the number one motivation of HP revenue over customer satisfactionThere are two completely unacceptable functional designs in this printer Each time you install a new inkjet cartridge the printer goes through a printer initializing process During this process the program sucks of the remaining ink cartridges installed So if you replace each of the four cartridges over a one week period without printing a single page each of the remaining cartridges will contain less ink once the last cartridge is installed This means that you basically have to replace all cartridges at the same time unless you dont mind wasting of your ink The MOST FRUSTRATING PART OF THIS PRINTER is the fact that you CANNOT PRINT unless all cartridges are fullSo I am getting ready for a critical meeting in hour I need to print a multimillion dollar proposal for my top client for this meeting I know I have plenty of black ink because I installed a new cartridge yesterday I go to print this important document and the printer WILL NOT PRINT MY BLACK AND WHITE DOCUMENT BECAUSE THE CYAN INK was now out of ink Now I know for a fact that this Cyan printer cartridge contained at least ink when I installed the new black ink cartridge because a ran the printer report So now I am panicking and grab another Cyan ink cartridge that I know contained of ink remaining when I replaced it It once again goes through it printer initializing process and now it wont print my BLACK AND WHITE DOCUMENT because the yellow ink is now gone Keep in mind the yellow ink had a little less than a of its ink remaining before I replaced the Black ink cartridge Now after replacing the Cyan cartridge now the yellow ink gone so I again replace it with a used cartridge that had about remaining but after this initializing process now all color ink cartridges are completely empty Keep in mind during this time I havent been able to PRINT a single document since replacing the Black cartridge the previous day So now I am completely out of three ink cartridges all because I changed out three cartridgesSo now I am so frustrated I want to throw the printer out my story office window if only the window opened In a last ditch effort I call HP Support to ask how I can bypass the color cartridges to print my black and white document I am told by support that the printer cannot print without the color cartridges When I ask why I am told that it is due to the printers high quality printing So when I ask how in Gods name does a yellow ink cartridge impact the quality of a black and white document I get crickets chirping from the support person until he asks if I would like to speak with a supervisor When I say yes he places me on hold until the system hangs up on me minutes later I call back now I immediately ask for a supervisor The supervisor tells me that is the way the printer is designed It uses color ink even in black and white documents to ensure quality printing and says he will send me a link to contact the CEO with my commentsMoral of the story NEVER buy a printer that requires color cartridges to print black and white documents There is only one reason that color ink is required to print black and white and it is to sell more ink cartridges This printer is purposefully wasting color inks in order to force the buyer to replace thecartridges as much as possible Until HP rewrites their printer software to eliminate this wasteful ink usage I think anyone that purchases any of their inkjet printers should have their head examined By the way I worked for HP in their Enterprise Software division so I am not just some HP hater,0,"['So', 'let', 'first', 'start', 'good', 'note',

2,I have had mixed results from Epson printers in the past but so far this product has been rather pleasing Its a wireless allinone with cloud printing collation thus sided printing a flatbed scanner document feeder and of course the fax monstrosity that just wont die It all manages to work on a level that is far less problem free than my previous experience with EpsonI like that this printer has a proper sleep function in that it goes to sleep breathes via LED when its sleeping and wakes when you need it whether over wifi or cloud print I like that it has a tray that automatically slides out if its needed The collation and double sided printing on a printer of this size is fantastic Cloud print is actually useful whether it be with Google or Epsons service And the software is actually not terribleWhat I dont like is the flimsy lid the now ink cartridge requirement one extra black for photo and the fact that the black ink that came with the product leaked all over This printer like all of them is an ink glutton Ink jet ink costs more than human blood so it would be nice if the printer companies stopped ripping us all off so spectacularly in that regardWith that being said the printer does a fine job printing a photo The price of ink and paper doesnt compete with Costcos printing service but the convenience is nice The printer uses low profile trays and automatically selects the correct paper for print jobs A motorized tray rolls out when the printer is printing which is great It does not however roll back in when it goes to sleepAside from the horrendous ink usage and the questionable quality of the ink cartridges themselves I do like this printer I recommend it as one of the best consumer grade printers Ive used Epson has managed to make dealing with printers slightly less tedious than before and that is progressUpdate The reason I hate printers is because they are all terrible at managing ink and dealing with empty cartridges This printer doesnt even allow you to print in black and white when one of the color cartridges is empty Not only that but its terrible at managing the ink It seems to run out after only or small print jobs It just feels like Im being scammed Why should I not be able to override the empty cartridge error It makes me want to take a hammer to itl terrible at managing ink and dealing with empty cartridges This printer

3,I have not used this exact model but we have four different earlier models with the same basic design as this printer The good prints well enough for office copies have not tried high quality photo printing rarely if ever jams on us fast draft copies scanner works well enough An incredible value and feature set for the money Also good is that the print head is not built into the ink tanks so you can get cheap ink replacements Surprisingly the ADF is reliable and doesnt jam when feeding multiple sheets as long as the pages arent dogeared The ones that we printscan with frequently every day have been real reliable workhorses The bad if you dont print often like going a week or two without printing eventually one of the print heads will clog This is pretty much true of almost any inkjet printer and the Brothers are no different Inkjet printers need to be used All inkjet printers including the Brother have head cleaning commands to fix this However at some point you will find that this is not enough and you simply cannot get the printer to print one or more colors When this happens your only hope is to clean the printheads manually The problem with the Brother printers of this design is that the print heads are buried inside the printer and are completely inaccessible Also it is impossible to disassemble the printer to access the print heads to clean them At some point if youre not consistently printing fairly often you may find that this product is hopelessly clogged and unusable as a printer as we have on two that we use infrequently For infrequent printing I would recommend looking at a plain inkjet printer that gives you easy access to the print heads Then again for this price if you only get a couple of years out of it its not all that bad,0,"['I', 'used', 'exact', 'model', 'four', 'different', 'earlier', 'models', 'basic', 'design', 'printer', 'The', 'good', 'prints', 'well', 'enough', 'office', 'copies', 'tried', 'high', 'quality', 'photo', 'printing', 'rarely', 'ever', 'jams', 'us', 'fast', 'draft', 'copies', 'scanner', 'works', 'well', 'enough', 'An', 'incredible', 'value', 'feature', 'set', 'money', 'Also', 'good', 'print', 'head', 'built', 'ink', 'tanks', 'get', 'cheap', 'ink', 'replacements', 'Surprisingly', 'ADF', 'reliable', 'doesnt', 'jam', 'feeding', 'multiple', 'sheets', 'long', 'pages', 'arent', 'dogeared', 'The', 'ones', 'printscan', 'frequently', 'every', 'day', 'real', 'reliable', 'workhorses', 'The', 'bad', 'dont', 'print', 'often', 'like', 'going', 'week', 'two', 'without', 'printing', 'eventually', 'one', 'print', 'heads', 'clog', 'This', 'pretty', 'much', 'true', 'almost', 'inkjet', 'printer', 'Brothers', 'different', 'Inkjet', 'printers', 'need', 'used', 'All', 'inkjet', 'printers', 'including', 'Brother', 'head', 'cleaning', 'commands', 'fix', 'However', 'point', 'find', 'enough', 'simply', 'get', 'printer', 'print', 'one', 'colors', 'When', 'happens', 'hope', 'clean', 'printheads', 'manually', 'The', 'problem', 'Brother', 'printers', 'design', 'print', 'heads', 'buried', 'inside', 'printer', 'completely', 'inaccessible', 'Also', 'impossible', 'disassemble', 'printer', 'access', 'print', 'heads', 'clean', 'At', 'point', 'youre', 'consistently', 'printing', 'fairly', 'often', 'may', 'find', 'product', 'hopelessly', 'clogged', 'unusable', 'printer', 'two', 'use', 'infrequently', 'For', 'infrequent', 'printing', 'I', 'would', 'recommend', 'looking', 'plain', 'inkjet', 'printer', 'gives', 'easy', 'access', 'print', 'heads', 'Then', 'price', 'get', 'couple', 'years', 'bad']"

1,June Update If amazon allowed me to change the number of stars I originally rated this item would change my original one star rating to stars I was pleased that Dixon the manufacturer showed Goodwill and sent me replacement boxes of pencils I would have given them stars but I still have problems with breaking lead I have found that the Dixon branded pencils by the same manufacturer have held up much better December Update I originally reviewed this product in April See my original review in the paragraph below It was based upon two separate purchases I made of the Dixon Ticonderoga box of a dozen pencils I had found that the lead was breaking constantly and or falling out Sharpening the pencils did not help The response that I got from a couple of other reviewers was that they couldnt disagree more with my review and that these were the best pencils they had ever owned One sarcastic reviewer commented that I should write a letter to the manufacturer Today I finally did contact the manufacturer and found out that yes indeed they did have a defect in the manufacturing of their pencils The defect has caused the pencil lead to break fall out and also to not sharpen properly They are supposed to send me replacement pencils I will update this review once I have received them and tried them April Review Ive never owned pencils that break as often as these do Im burning through a box of so quickly it is crazy It appears that they werent glued together very well during manufacture so they dont hold the lead evenly when they are sharpened Consequently the lead breaks very often Apparently Im not the only one that has experienced this with Ticonderoga Pencils Refer to the review of DIX Ticonderoga PencilsASINBUXOA DIX Ticonderoga Pencils,0,"['June', 'Update', 'If', 'amazon', 'allowed', 'change', 'number', 'stars', 'I', 'originally', 'rated', 'item', 'would', 'change', 'original', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'stars', 'I', 'pleased', 'Dixon', 'manufacturer', 'showed', 'Goodwill', 'sent', 'replacement', 'boxes', 'pencils', 'I', 'would', 'given', 'stars', 'I', 'still', 'problems', 'breaking', 'lead', 'I', 'found', 'Dixon', 'branded', 'pencils', 'manufacturer', 'held', 'much', 'better', 'December', 'Update', 'I', 'originally', 'reviewed', 'product', 'April', 'See', 'original', 'review', 'paragraph', 'It', 'based', 'upon', 'two', 'separate', 'purchases', 'I', 'made', 'Dixon', 'Ticonderoga', 'box', 'dozen', 'pencils', 'I', 'found', 'lead', 'breaking', 'constantly', 'falling', 'Sharpening', 'pencils', 'help', 'The', 'response', 'I', 'got', 'couple', 'reviewers', 'couldnt', 'disagree', 'review', 'best', 'pencils', 'ever', 'owned', 'One', 'sarcastic', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'I', 'write', 'letter', 'manufacturer', 'Today', 'I', 'finally', 'contact', 'manufacturer', 'found', 'yes', 'indeed', 'defect', 'manufacturing', 'pencils', 'The', 'defect', 'caused', 'pencil', 'lead', 'break', 'fall', 'also', 'sharpen', 'properly', 'They', 'supposed', 'send', 'replacement', 'pencils', 'I', 'update', 'review', 'I', 'received', 'tried', 'April', 'Review', 'Ive', 'never', 'owned', 'pencils', 'break', 'often', 'Im', 'burning', 'box', 'quickly', 'crazy', 'It', 'appears', 'werent', 'glued', 'together', 'well', 'manufacture', 'dont', 'hold', 'lead', 'evenly', 'sharpened', 'Consequently', 'lead', 'breaks', 'often', 'Apparently', 'Im', 'one', 'experienced', 'Ticonderoga', 'Pencils', 'Refer', 'review', 'DIX', 'Ticonderoga', 'PencilsASINBUXOA', 'DIX', 'Ticonderoga', 'Pencils']"

5,I bought this PDA after extensive obsessing over web reviews product information specs and visiting the red shirted and blue shirted sales associates at my local tech retail stores I chose the Casio BE for its functional ability and to supplement not replace my laptop I highly recommend this unit for those of you who like me need a small inexpensive yet fully functional color display PDA to record your calendar events take quick notes maintain Outlooklike contact lists and check basic email This unit does all this beautifully and synchronizes well with Outlook The only strange synchronization Ive found is that items sent from the PDA to Outlook are sometimes misspelled but never in the other direction I wonder if this is more due to my typing using the stylus and the smaller display rather than an actual synch problem The entire synch process is very easy to set up and operates seamlessly for calendar appointments todo tasks contact lists etcAs for the lack of software I dont use a PDA to play games use Word and manage spreadsheets for those I rely on real computers with at least a display great graphics card lots of RAM and cache a real joystick mouse and keyboard and a true sound system I just cant do this cramped by a screen smaller than a floppy disk I know how frustrating this can be because in my real computer was an OsborneI with a screen So trust me on this work in an ergonomic environment and if you seek diversion on those long flights buy an inexpensive hand held game and use this PDA for your true business needsIf youve used Pocket PCs in the past you will likely be thrown a bit by the menu system it reminds me of the old DOS shells such as dirplus that dont give you a functional desktop but require you to work through set menu choices listing its functions and programs Thats actually MORE user friendly when you think about the ease with which you can access your programsLastly you can easily add basic accessories such as compact flash memory and modem cards The BE is the roughly the same size as a Handspring Visor so if you want to put it in a carrying case you can use one that is compatible with Visor The only negative I can say at this time after one month ownership is that the battery seems to depelete pretty quickly I use it daily on and off and at the end of each day I seem to have to left only That may be normal for a PDA but seems fast to me,1,"['I', 'bought', 'PDA', 'extensive', 'obsessing', 'web', 'reviews', 'product', 'information', 'specs', 'visiting', 'red', 'shirted', 'blue', 'shirted', 'sales', 'associates', 'local', 'tech', 'retail', 'stores', 'I', 'chose', 'Casio', 'BE', 'functional', 'ability', 'supplement', 'replace', 'laptop', 'I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'unit', 'like', 'need', 'small', 'inexpensive', 'yet', 'fully', 'functional', 'color', 'display', 'PDA', 'record', 'calendar', 'events', 'take', 'quick', 'notes', 'maintain', 'Outlooklike', 'contact', 'lists', 'check', 'basic', 'email', 'This', 'unit', 'beautifully', 'synchronizes', 'well', 'Outlook', 'The', 'strange', 'synchronization', 'Ive', 'found', 'items', 'sent', 'PDA', 'Outlook', 'sometimes', 'misspelled', 'never', 'direction', 'I', 'wonder', 'due', 'typing', 'using', 'stylus', 'smaller', 'display', 'rather', 'actual', 'synch', 'problem', 'The', 'entire', 'synch', 'process', 'easy', 'set', 'operates', 'seamlessly', 'calendar', 'appointments', 'todo', 'tasks', 'contact', 'lists', 'etcAs', 'lack', 'software', 'I', 'dont', 'use', 'PDA', 'play', 'games', 'use', 'Word', 'manage', 'spreadsheets', 'I', 'rely', 'real', 'computers', 'least', 'display', 'great', 'graphics', 'card', 'lots', 'RAM', 'cache', 'real', 'joystick', 'mouse', 'keyboard', 'true', 'sound', 'system', 'I', 'cant', 'cramped', 'screen', 'smaller', 'floppy', 'disk', 'I', 'know', 'frustrating', 'real', 'computer', 'OsborneI', 'screen', 'So', 'trust', 'work', 'ergonomic', 'environment', 'seek', 'diversion', 'long', 'flights', 'buy', 'inexpensive', 'hand', 'held', 'game', 'use', 'PDA', 'true', 'business', 'needsIf', 'youve', 'used', 'Pocket', 'PCs', 'past', 'likely', 'thrown', 'bit', 'menu', 'system', 'reminds', 'old', 'DOS', 'shells', 'dirplus', 'dont', 'give', 'functional', 'desktop', 'require', 'work', 'set', 'menu', 'choices', 'listing', 'functions', 'programs', 'Thats', 'actually', 'MORE', 'user', 'friendly', 'think', 'ease', 'access', 'programsLastly', 'easily', 'add', 'basic', 'accessories', 'compact', 'flash', 'memory', 'modem', 'cards', 'The', 'BE', 'roughly', 'size', 'Handspring', 'Visor', 'want', 'put', 'carrying', 'case', 'use', 'one', 'compatible', 'Visor', 'The', 'negative', 'I', 'say', 'time', 'one', 'month', 'ownership', 'battery', 'seems', 'depelete', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'I', 'use', 'daily', 'end', 'day', 'I', 'seem', 'left', 'That', 'may', 'normal', 'PDA', 'seems', 'fast']"

4,Hi thereI bought this remote just a week ago as a tool for practicing presentations in a related course I am takingGoing through all motes I can find in the local marketthere are Kensingtons and other brands remotes I find this the most ergonomically designed and I love the green laser it is really clearer comparing to the redThe price is fair with the above for other models are at similar price levelIts thin the audience wont even notice you are having something at your hand for your hand can cover it well naturally Its easy to hold and allows me to keep my gestures during the presentation The texture is skinlike so you dont need much force to grab itThe timer is another highlight over other models A precise timing is allowed and you always have the idea on the flow especially useful when you are playing as a team For example I set minutes for my part when there were minutes left it vibrated to remind me finally vibrated again when the time is upThe buttons are well designed for easy clicking the large forward and backward keys at the middle cost you no effort to reach As mentioned in the most critical comment here there is a small exit and start button right below the backward keysomeone may accidentally click them and ruin the presentationLuckily that was not the case for our group when we were presenting That button is small enough that misclicking is unlikely to happen Still I agreed that it would be better to have options turning off this keyThere are some small but necessary improvements I can point out after using it for a few daysThe cover of the batteries is not firm I didnt mean it will fall off easily but it doesnt feel good that I find it slightly movable when I am holding the remoteAfter detaching the receiver from the remote looking through that hole actually I can see the PCBscomponentsthe electronic stuff inside the remoteWhen you are using it you may have to avoid dropping something through this hole into the remote or it would be very hard to remove them you may have some objects keeping rolling in your remotes as a resultIt would be nice if they can add a cover internally for that partThanks for your

4,I have always preferred HP printers over other brands for many reasons They are usually well made and dont feel as though they are entirely constructed of plastic The Pro is typical HP in that regard It is big like the older models and sturdy The setup didnt take me as long as some of the other reviewers said it would which makes me think I may not have done it as thoroughly as I was supposed to I like others had some problems setting up the fax feature so I never got through thatThe prints do come out quickly I will give it that For my purposes the best ink coverage occurs with smooth white paper You really have to experiment with the paper you use to get the best effect for the type of printing you do most It appears to me HP has done something here to conserve ink which is a good thing unless it compromises quality In my case I do a lot of heavy color printing I have to reproduce x fullcolor artwork one after the other sometimes for hours Sounds as though its a tough test for a printer but I have been doing this on my HP Officejet AllInOne for years and years and it has been a champ I absolutely do not see the being up to the job Truthfully I have tried a lot of other printers just to see if I could find one I could use concurrently with my to share some of the burden I want the to last as long as it possibly can because they just dont make them like this any moreWhile the is advertised as a color photo printer AllInOne its use for me will be limited to quickly printing letters and documents and occasional throwawayquality color pieces I would say I was being too picky about the quality of the color prints if I hadnt had the good fortune to own a all these years HP has spoiled me But considering the cost over when I bought it and this one is way less than that amount I can use the for its strengths and keep my for its superior color printing,1,"['I', 'always', 'preferred', 'HP', 'printers', 'brands', 'many', 'reasons', 'They', 'usually', 'well', 'made', 'dont', 'feel', 'though', 'entirely', 'constructed', 'plastic', 'The', 'Pro', 'typical', 'HP', 'regard', 'It', 'big', 'like', 'older', 'models', 'sturdy', 'The', 'setup', 'didnt', 'take', 'long', 'reviewers', 'said', 'would', 'makes', 'think', 'I', 'may', 'done', 'thoroughly', 'I', 'supposed', 'I', 'like', 'others', 'problems', 'setting', 'fax', 'feature', 'I', 'never', 'got', 'thatThe', 'prints', 'come', 'quickly', 'I', 'give', 'For', 'purposes', 'best', 'ink', 'coverage', 'occurs', 'smooth', 'white', 'paper', 'You', 'really', 'experiment', 'paper', 'use', 'get', 'best', 'effect', 'type', 'printing', 'It', 'appears', 'HP', 'done', 'something', 'conserve', 'ink', 'good', 'thing', 'unless', 'compromises', 'quality', 'In', 'case', 'I', 'lot', 'heavy', 'color', 'printing', 'I', 'reproduce', 'x', 'fullcolor', 'artwork', 'one', 'sometimes', 'hours', 'Sounds', 'though', 'tough', 'test', 'printer', 'I', 'HP', 'Officejet', 'AllInOne', 'years', 'years', 'champ', 'I', 'absolutely', 'see', 'job', 'Truthfully', 'I', 'tried', 'lot', 'printers', 'see', 'I', 'could', 'find', 'one', 'I', 'could', 'use', 'concurrently', 'share', 'burden', 'I', 'want', 'last', 'long', 'possibly', 'dont', 'make', 'like', 'moreWhile', 'advertised', 'color', 'photo', 'printer', 'AllInOne', 'use', 'limited', 'quickly', 'printing', 'letters', 'documents', 'occasional', 'throwawayquality', 'color', 'pieces', 'I', 'would', 'say', 'I', 'picky', 'quality', 'color', 'prints', 'I', 'hadnt', 'good', 'fortune', 'years', 'HP', 'spoiled', 'But', 'considering', 'cost', 'I', 'bought', 'one', 'way', 'less', 'amount', 'I', 'use', 'strengths', 'keep', 'superior', 'color', 'printing']"

4,Having never owned a pico projector before I was intrigued by the idea of them My old projector has a blown bulb and instead of spending another for a new bulb I decided I would give this a whirl I spend a lot of time at work or traveling so I wanted something to have handy if I ever wanted to play a game or watch a video on the go I just received my pk today and here are my initial impressionsPros Very small Lightweight Still feels durable despite and Bright picturethis one shocked me In my living room with the lights on granted this took place at night I could clearly see the picture when projected onto a wall across the room I imagine the result with my projector screen will be better Built in card reader and decoder work well I loaded some avis onto a memory card to test out how this would work Not only did it work quickly it also was able to find the avis I nested within a folder Built in speaker works surprisingly well Seems like optoma listened to some of the feedback from earlier models and included a remote and some accessories with this model Padded case seems niceCons There is no keystone adjustment feature This is actually a large issue in part because of the size of this unit If you put this on a tabledeskfurnitureetc theres a high chance you will not be directly centered from where you are projecting the image The tilt updownto the side causes very visible distortion in the image shape Its still watchable but this seems like a huge oversight for a projector that cost Fan is loud when on bright mode lumens Fan noise is most definitely audible when the projector is running at lumens This isnt a deal breaker and honestly its not terribly loud Even though the padded case seems nice there is no spot to put your charger or any accessories Unit heats upquickly I havent had it on for prolonged periods yet so Im not sure how this will effect the picture quality or processing I can tell you that during my minute trial runs today it became warm to the touch These were all during lumen bright mode tests so perhaps the effect is not as great on the normal mode Cords for accessories are short and move the projector if you are adjusting the input device position To fix this and help fix problem I would recommend getting a good minitripod I wouldnt skimp on something in the range I personally went with ASINBEVSLRO Joby GPAEN Gorillapod Flexible Tripod Grey and Black It was still relatively cheap and does an excellent job holding the projector firmly in position I imagine that tripod will also come in handy when I want to bring the projector outdoors along with some external speakers to have a movie night with friends No lens cap for the projector The lens appears to be made of plastic and is recessed but this still seems like an area for concern A small modification to add a lens cap which I cant imagine would cost much could have corrected this issueIll try to do a more detailed review soon and maybe a video review if I get enough time Overall I am pleased with the projector but I still have some other tests I want to do before rendering a final verdict If you go into this purchase expecting to get high definition movie theater quality imagesyou will be disappointed If you go into this realizing you are trading off movie theater quality picture and a huge projector in exchange for ease of portability while still maintaining a good picture you will likely be happyInitially Id give this a Update After having some time to play around with this I have some additional comments The sound is not nearly as loud as I thought when you are in a large room It is still better than nothing but you will likely need an external speaker of some sort to fully enjoy this Not a deal breaker though this is a small projector so this shouldnt come as a shock The unit is not as bright when played for a long time This was expected as Optoma has admitted their projector dims itself slightly if it gets too hot Mainly mentioning this so others are aware this is normal behavior I have had some severe problems when playing media directly off the projector either via micro SD or internal memory In a handful of cases the audio is out of sync In one case the audio did not play at all Other times when moving from one video file to another the projector simply will not play the file If I restart the projector the file plays fine These examples are all using files that meet the Optoma specifications for what the projector can play back I thought that there may be a chance the firmware was outdated but when I went to the Optoma site I couldnt even find firmware for this model Seems to be a big oversight I plan to call tech support tomorrow to find out what is going on Im going to do further testing on this issue but yesterday I started up my projector and after the Optoma logo I got a blank white screen It did not take me to the menu This continued several times until I plugged the projector into the charger Im not sure if this is normal behavior for when the unit is low on battery or if there is a bigger issue This is another item I plan to address with tech support tomorrowOverall I am still happy with this unit but a lot will be riding on my interaction with Optoma tech support tomorrow Ill keep this updated with the results Also I did get a chance to take some pictures in full fluorescent lighting as well as dim lighting Ill post those in a future updateUpdate I contacted Optoma tech support and they confirmed that myunit is faulty They said it either has bad software or a bad battery Strangely they advised me to return the unit to Amazon and have Amazon fulfill a new unit Strange specifically because the paper inside the box says STOP Call tech support and send your unit in for repair before returning it to your place of purchaseAt any rate I have my new unit now and Ill be testing it out during the week,1,"['Having', 'never', 'owned',

1,I have purchased several of these Handspring GPS springboards and the Geoid though twice the price has the least functionality of any of them First the compass requires that you calibrate each time you are in a different environment This requires that you go through a compass set up process that includes holding the unit level and spinning slowly around in a circle This quickly grows annoying as you have to set it whenever you use the unit I tried calibrating in my car and the unit never would calibrate Whether intended or not most people will be buying this unit for use in the car Since it was unable to be calibrated in the car the icon showing the direction of travel never did work accurately The identity of streets are a mystery until you actually select them with your stylus Again when trying to drive to a location this is akward You either have to pull your car over everytime you need a street name or you pull this manuever off while driving Nearly impossible in a shaky car To navigate to a point their is no ability to indicate where the point is in reference to your current location So your only option is to zoom out to the extent that you can see both your location and the target location This makes it increasingly difficult to select a certain road and identify which one to take to your targetIn conclusion there are better springboards available for half the price Dont waste your money,0,"['I', 'purchased', 'several', 'Handspring', 'GPS', 'springboards', 'Geoid', 'though', 'twice', 'price', 'least', 'functionality', 'First', 'compass', 'requires', 'calibrate', 'time', 'different', 'environment', 'This', 'requires', 'go', 'compass', 'set', 'process', 'includes', 'holding', 'unit', 'level', 'spinning', 'slowly', 'around', 'circle', 'This', 'quickly', 'grows', 'annoying', 'set', 'whenever', 'use', 'unit', 'I', 'tried', 'calibrating', 'car', 'unit', 'never', 'would', 'calibrate', 'Whether', 'intended', 'people', 'buying', 'unit', 'use', 'car', 'Since', 'unable', 'calibrated', 'car', 'icon', 'showing', 'direction', 'travel', 'never', 'work', 'accurately', 'The', 'identity', 'streets', 'mystery', 'actually', 'select', 'stylus', 'Again', 'trying', 'drive', 'location', 'akward', 'You', 'either', 'pull', 'car', 'everytime', 'need', 'street', 'name', 'pull', 'manuever', 'driving', 'Nearly', 'impossible', 'shaky', 'car', 'To', 'navigate', 'point', 'ability', 'indicate', 'point', 'reference', 'current', 'location', 'So', 'option', 'zoom', 'extent', 'see', 'location', 'target', 'location', 'This', 'makes', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'select', 'certain', 'road', 'identify', 'one', 'take', 'targetIn', 'conclusion', 'better', 'springboards', 'available', 'half', 'price', 'Dont', 'waste', 'money']"

1,I bought this printer when my old HP allinone finally died after six years and wouldnt pick up paper any longer Im giving the printer two stars because the color output does look nice for regular pages Ive not tried printing any photos on it so I cant really comment on thatNow for the negatives I spend a huge amount of time clearing nonexistent paper jams from this printer Basically anytime the printer doesnt want to pick up the paper which is often it decides it has a paper jam Clearing a paper jam requires removing the back cover This means that the printer really cant be conveniently located against a wall unless you want to keep pulling it out and turning it around Repeatedly taking off the back cover and reinstalling it seems for me at least to inevitably lead to slightly misaligning the print head When the printer sees this condition it requires a recalibration Other printers Ive owned have made recalibration optional but for this printer it seems to be mandatory You cant use it again until it prints the calibration page The calibration page uses lots of ink Speaking of ink usage the printer seems to use more ink than other printers Ive owned So even though the ink may cost a tiny bit less than other brands youll go through more of it The printer also requires both color and BW cartridges with ink in them in order to print Other printers typically allow you to print with one if the other is dry as long as the empty cartridge is still in the slot So even if you plan to print only BW youll end up using the more expensive color cartridge anyway I had to uninstall the antivirussecurity program CA Security Center on my laptop in order to use the wireless feature with this printer I finally found that Microsoft Security Essentials does work okay with the printer I tried to find some way to get both to work at the same time but it was impossible Im not technologically challengedIm the ops manager for a supercomputing center The wireless component of the printer software is just very cumbersome and difficult to work withIn sum I wish I hadnt been taken in by the claims of cheaper printing made on the packaging This printer has been a headache Once I feel like I have gotten my moneys worth out of it then Ill give it away and go buy a new HP The old HP wasnt perfect but it printed on the first try every time never jammed allowed for BWonly printingcopying and seemed to have a less intrusive software interfaceEditing My Review Ive changed my review from two stars to one star Now when the printer does pick up paper which is still seldom it doesnt actually print anything on the page It feeds the page through and makes all of the noises one would expect when a page is printing but the output is blank All of the components are installed correctly and the ink cartridges are at least half full so there is no obvious reason for this to happen I suppose I could try to go through all of the troubleshooting procedures and looking up codes on the Kodak Web site etc but Ive wasted enough time and frustration already,0,"['I', 'bought', 'printer', 'old', 'HP', 'allinone', 'finally', 'died', 'six', 'years', 'wouldnt', 'pick', 'paper',

3,Averys White Repositionable Address Labels arrived in a welldesigned professionally wrapped packageSix labels using three label sheets were produced on a laser HP printer The labels designation is but wellpositioned instructions were placed right below that number telling the user to use Averys template to run the labelsThe box advises guaranteed smudge free and jam free and in both cases they were Avery advertises their Popup Edge for fast peeling and that feature also worked as advertisedFor this test we sent selfaddressed white envelopes using Sparco brand Regular Business Envelopes model manufactured by SP Richards Company of Atlanta GA This information is included as Avery advised on the box that results may vary based on paper characteristics that the product could be attached toThe envelopes were address to our home but also two PO boxes that are not at the same location This would guarantee different handlings as the labels traveled through the postal systemThe labels were attached to the envelopes and all three were removed and repositioned Five minutes later they were pulled up and repositioned again all with no difficulty Then they were placed on a car seat loose in a heated garage whose temperature was about degrees After an overnight stay all three were inspected and all three had lifted off the envelope about a quarter inch on the right side of the label They were pushed down on the envelopes and they stayed down all three were placed under a heavy bookThree hours later they were inspected again and all three were fully attached They were then mailed at a post office unrelated to either post office destination and we waited for deliveryThe next day all three arrived at their destinations All three were firmly attached to their envelopes With considerable effort we were able to peel back one corner on one label but under all reasonable circumstances the labels had firmly attached to the envelope just as advertisedWe now have a problem The instructions advised that results may vary based on paper characteristics All three labels lifted after an overnight stay in a car but in fairness all three were attached to envelopes made by the same vendor so we pressed on Two extra return envelopes from various vendors were labeled and also a label was affixed to the letter from Avery that described the product All three were placed loose on the car seat just as the first three wereThe next morning all three showed very minor lifting on the right side of the label Not much but they could be peeled off easily All three were pressed down and they stayed down No weight was placed on them and three hours later they had fully adhered to the document and the two envelopes and could have been mailedConclusion These labels do many of the things they advertise right out of the box and do of what they advertise but as you saw time and effort was required I would not feel confident in mailing an important document using these labels

4,First off Amazon had the cheapest price on this printer ANYWHERE It looks out of stock now but if it came back in stock this is the place to get it I bought this for my husband for Christmas He actually needed a new scanner as his was old but our generic printer could have been updated too And I liked that it had the copy feature The prints are quick and quite good We havent tried printing anything major or any photos yet but so far no problems with the printing He had a slight issue with the scanner at first It took FOREVER to scan because it actually has to configure itself before every single scan But even we were suspicious at the amount of time it took So he called tech support and they told him that one of his Mac drivers were out of date So he downloaded new ones and problem solved It still has to configure itself every time you scanunless you keep scan on the whole time but its nowhere near as slow After the scan actually gets goin its very quick And honestly I think the constant configuration is for people that have a Mac or at least that is what the tech guy told him We havent tried the slide scanning feature yet or the copier But for this price range it has everything you are looking for and I think its a great deal Also my husband is a graphic designer so he needs his scans to be crisp looking and I know hes satisfied so it was worth it just for that One minor issue is the size of the printer It is pretty large but if you have a decent amount of room on your table we have Lshaped desks then its not really a big deal The LCD screen is a neat feature as well,1,"['First', 'Amazon', 'cheapest', 'price', 'printer', 'ANYWHERE', 'It', 'looks', 'stock', 'came', 'back', 'stock', 'place', 'get', 'I', 'bought', 'husband', 'Christmas', 'He', 'actually', 'needed', 'new', 'scanner', 'old', 'generic', 'printer', 'could', 'updated', 'And', 'I', 'liked', 'copy', 'feature', 'The', 'prints', 'quick', 'quite', 'good', 'We', 'havent', 'tried', 'printing', 'anything', 'major', 'photos', 'yet', 'far', 'problems', 'printing', 'He', 'slight', 'issue', 'scanner', 'first', 'It', 'took', 'FOREVER', 'scan', 'actually', 'configure', 'every', 'single', 'scan', 'But', 'even', 'suspicious', 'amount', 'time', 'took', 'So', 'called', 'tech', 'support', 'told', 'one', 'Mac', 'drivers', 'date', 'So', 'downloaded', 'new', 'ones', 'problem', 'solved', 'It', 'still', 'configure', 'every', 'time', 'scanunless', 'keep', 'scan', 'whole', 'time', 'nowhere', 'near', 'slow', 'After', 'scan', 'actually', 'gets', 'goin', 'quick', 'And', 'honestly', 'I', 'think', 'constant', 'configuration', 'people', 'Mac', 'least', 'tech', 'guy', 'told', 'We', 'havent', 'tried', 'slide', 'scanning', 'feature', 'yet', 'copier', 'But', 'price', 'range', 'everything', 'looking', 'I', 'think', 'great', 'deal', 'Also', 'husband', 'graphic', 'designer', 'needs', 'scans', 'crisp', 'looking', 'I', 'know', 'hes', 'satisfied', 'worth', 'One', 'minor', 'issue', 'size', 'printer', 'It', 'pretty', 'large', 'decent', 'amount', 'room', 'table', 'Lshaped', 'desks', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'The', 'LCD', 'screen', 'neat', 'feature', 'well']"

1,Ok this is the review you want to read for historical use of the printerSo when I initially bought this printer it was great Brand spanking new with that new printerelectronic smell Setup was a breeze The install went without a single issue on WiFi and USB Faxing Copying Printing all worked fine and the prints were fabulous So stars for printing a photo or a couple pages of something This was my thought upon unboxing it and using it the first couple of daysThus the downfall beginsAbout month later I had to replace both the Black and Color cartridges I had only printed maybe sheets up to this point I figured it was because they were starter cartridges and didnt think anything of it because I was told Kodaks Ink per Dollar value was the best on the market So I went to my local Staples bought the cheaper than the competition cartridges installed them and was back in business And just to be clear I mean actual name brand Kodak cartridges and not some knockoff brand I only use the phrase cheaper than the competition to make a point and you will see more as you read thisAbout months later I got the Ink is low messages for the cartridges Their levels were a little different so it wasnt like the software keeping track was faulty thinking both were low but really I think Id only printed about pages this time and mostly BW text so I started scratching my head as to why the color would be so low I wasnt even breaking the pages mark So I checked online for some tips and realized that I was always printing the highest quality prints even if it was just a quick BW text page So I adjusted the resolution down to half went back to Staples once again bought the cheaper than the competition cartridges installed them and was back in businessAnother months later Ink is low So adjusting the print quality extended me more month I think this time I made it to about or pages Again mostly BW text yet both Black and Color were low OK at this point I knew something was up I check the printer for leaks checked the Printer Heads ran the calibrations everything checked out fine I also found that when the Black gets low the Color cartridges starts to fill in to create black This would explain why they were both showing low Even though I was mainly printing BW text the black was obviously draining so quickly that the color took over and drained quickly as well But again just months and less than pagesSo I started consulting reviews and quickly found that although a lot of people like myself felt this was an awesome to star printer that feeling quickly faded to a star It doesnt matter if your to purchase of ink is cheaper than the competition if you are constantly having to buy cartridges for basic printing every monthsSo I have decided to replace it with a laser printer that can print pages off of toner cartridge and has the history to back it up Even with the knowledge that the cost of a laser toner cartridge is higher when compared side by side to an inkjet

2,The machine itself is another Canon product good for pictures and general printing It is extremely slow on startup We dont let it sit and idle wasting power when its not used for days at a time We turn it on when we need it and it cranks and cranks and cranks this goes on for about three to four minutes cleaning its jets with expensive ink I suppose that is why the machine is cheap they make up for it on the ink supplies Id try cheaper ink but I am afraid of the end results Id like to believe that Canon would come through and fix this problem with this and other machines but they wont they dont fix them once they are released they are too busy designing the next model and how they can get it to bring in more by using more inkBeside the above problem it is complicated to operate the manual doesnt give you an easy way to find and understand the procedures to do certain things like print cds You have to wait to insert the cd when the machine tells you to not before It was hard to understand how to hook up wirelessly some steps didnt explain the steps in total you have to assume what it needs to link up took about an hour of try this then try thatHavent used the negativeslide copier yet hope it works well It doesnt come with a cable to connect to usb portThe colors it does produce are excellent sharp Black on white printing is also very good The print platform you must use to print cds with is very slow very step by step dont expect to zip through anything It doesnt give a blank cd background you must delete all the background items that are standard in several choices You cant just insert a simple name and print it you must delete all the extra pretty things they thought you would love to have on a cddvd Picture printing is fairly easy however and does a good jobFor the price Id buy it again wireless prints good does cddvds negativesslides and seems to work well But Im sure it will cost a ton in ink,0,"['The', 'machine', 'another', 'Canon', 'product', 'good', 'pictures', 'general', 'printing', 'It', 'extremely', 'slow', 'startup', 'We', 'dont', 'let', 'sit', 'idle', 'wasting', 'power', 'used', 'days', 'time', 'We', 'turn', 'need', 'cranks', 'cranks', 'cranks', 'goes', 'three', 'four', 'minutes', 'cleaning', 'jets', 'expensive', 'ink', 'I', 'suppose', 'machine', 'cheap', 'make', 'ink', 'supplies', 'Id', 'try', 'cheaper', 'ink', 'I', 'afraid', 'end', 'results', 'Id', 'like', 'believe', 'Canon', 'would', 'come', 'fix', 'problem', 'machines', 'wont', 'dont', 'fix', 'released', 'busy', 'designing', 'next', 'model', 'get', 'bring', 'using', 'inkBeside', 'problem', 'complicated', 'operate', 'manual', 'doesnt', 'give', 'easy', 'way', 'find', 'understand', 'procedures', 'certain', 'things', 'like', 'print', 'cds', 'You', 'wait', 'insert', 'cd', 'machine', 'tells', 'It', 'hard', 'understand', 'hook', 'wirelessly', 'steps', 'didnt', 'explain', 'steps', 'total', 'assume', 'needs', 'link', 'took', 'hour', 'try', 'try', 'thatHavent', 'used', 'negativeslide', 'copier', 'yet', 'hope', 'works', 'well', 'It', 'doesnt', 'come', 'cable', 'connect', 'usb', 'portThe', 'colors', 'produce', 'excellent', 'sharp', 'Black', 'white', 'printing', 'also', 'good', 'The', 'print', 'platform', 'must', 'use', 'print', 'cds', 'slow', 'step', 'step', 'dont', 'expect', 'zip', 'anything', 'It', 'doesnt', 'give', 'blank', 'cd', 'background', 'must', 'delete', 'background', 'items', 'standard', 'several', 'choices', 'You', 'cant', 'insert', 'simple', 'name', 'print', 'must', 'delete', 'extra', 'pretty', 'things', 'thought', 'would', 'love', 'cddvd', 'Picture', 'printing', 'fairly', 'easy', 'however', 'good', 'jobFor', 'price', 'Id', 'buy', 'wireless', 'prints', 'good', 'cddvds', 'negativesslides', 'seems', 'work', 'well', 'But', 'Im', 'sure', 'cost', 'ton', 'ink']"

1,BTW Assuming you own Neat software you cannot purchase a scanner without a second purchase of the software Greta sales idea UPDATE IS AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW as of JAN Ive spent over hours running uninstallsreinstalls and registry cleans and under direction of two technical support representatives gone into file folder permissions and changed permissions and ownership all installation issues that the reps acknowledge are failures in their installation script for Windows To put it bluntly on a vanilla Windows notebook they are unable to have the product install without it crashing either instantly or after a few minutes of use Great Idea Terrible implementation If you have Windows DONT EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRODUCT NEAT is in violation of IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY Why IT DONT WORK Received NeatReceipts yesterday ASINBCQFRPO NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner and Digital Filing System Went to do install today found that the installation CD was out of date so downloaded the most currect version software from Neatcom and installed without error This is a Win configuration Dell M Installed Neat handheld scanner Started using the product entered a few receipts to learn the filing and categorizing parameters Walked away for a moment and on return found a popup error message Neat has stopped working and Windows is closing Neat because it has stopped working Tried to reload and reexecute it it loads momentarily into the task list and then abendscrashes almost immediately same error messages Did a complete reinstall Used for about hours loaded a number of receipts in to Neat trashed the receipts WRONG MOVE Why went for dinner came back to find Neat had abendedcrashed again back in same situation no access to data entered and the images cannot be accessed without Neat nonstandard storage method Sent support inquiry to Neat Got back a truly nonsensical response Based on what youve asked the following answers might be relevant The following answers might help you immediately Title Connecting Your QuickBooks Company File to Neat Link Hmmm I have never had Quickbooks Dont have Quickbooks Never said I hasd Quickbooks It was never mentioned in the installation process Never said anything about Quickbooks in the support inquiry RESPONSE TO RON in the Neat Forum Ron and any one else reading Yes after several days including much time on the telephone at least for my configuration which is Windows gb memory the problem was the install script being deficient in how it set filefolder permission Before I go on you may ask as you read the next sentence why in heck does Neat SP required total administrative control of your machine but Ill let you try to get the answer The solution is go in to the folder properties for Neat located as follows Program FilesCommon FilesNeatReceipts Program FilesNeat Program DataThe Neat Company and the desktop shortcut for Neat and modify the properties of all folders and subfolders within or the properties of the shortcut for security so that YOUR OWN SPECIFIC LOGON on this machine as opposed to already Administrators etc has FULL CONTROL The result then is the program works SO LONG AS YOUR MACHINE DOES NOT GO IN TO POWER STANDBY or SLEEP or worse So you now have a working program as long as you remember to either keep the machine from going in to an idle state or you shut the program if you know you are going to walk away for a bit Now today I spent time on the phone with a nice young man in Philadelphia who explained to me that they had never heard of this problem before so there was no way for them to debug it As for the obvious questions of why does the program so violate windows security and why is the install script not correct your guess is as good as mine So if you wantto tell the nice young man that you too have experienced this supposed oneoff error use TICKET Incident Best to all and to you Ron good luck,0,"['BTW', 'Assuming', 'Neat', 'software', 'purchase',
